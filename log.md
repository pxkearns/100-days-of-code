# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 3, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Getting Started on my Tribute Page, Did some review and made more progress on the coding lessons on FreeCodeCamp. 
**Thoughts:** I don't feel like i've done much yet , Just setting for what's to come but I'm looking forward to it. As far as the Tribute Page goes. I did alot of Brainstorming on who i want to make it for. But realized how terrible I'd feel to make a bad tribute page for someone else (especially if they are a way better coder than me, they'd just look at my work and say "DISGUSTING") so i figured I'd just make the tribute page for myself, that way down the road i can look at this and hate myself for what I did but  feel for putting up a an ugly tribute page for someone else.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
